Classes in Python

* You can get a long way with Python's built-in scalar and
  'collections' types.
* But when they're not right for the job, you can use classes
  to create custom types.

- *Structure and Behavior
* Classes define the structure and behavior of objects.
* An object's class controls its initialization.

- *Classes are a Tool
* Classes make complex problems tractable.
* Classes can make simple solutions overly complex.
  -* "Python lets you find the right balance
      with OOP and Classes."
