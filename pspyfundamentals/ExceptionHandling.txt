Python Exception Handling

* Exception Handling is a mechanism for stopping "normal" program flow and
continuing at some surrounding context or code block.

* Raise an exception to interrupt program flow.

* Handle an exception to resume control.

* Unhandled exceptions will terminate the program.

* Exception objects contain information about the exceptional event.
