Classes in Python

* You can get a long way with Python's built-in scalar and
  'collections' types.
* But when they're not right for the job, you can use classes
  to create custom types.

- *Structure and Behavior
* Classes define the structure and behavior of objects.
* An object's class controls its initialization.

- *Classes are a Tool
* Classes make complex problems tractable.
* Classes can make simple solutions overly complex.
  -* "Python lets you find the right balance
      with OOP and Classes."

Defining Classes

* By convention, class names use CamelCase

Methods

* Method - A function defined within a class
* Instance methods - functions which can be called on objects
* self - the first argument to all instance methods

Initializers

* __init__() instance method for initializing new objects
* 'self' s similar to 'this' in C++ or Java.
- *Why _number?
    - 1. Avoid name clash with number()
    - 2. By convention, implementation details start with
         underscore

Class Invariants

* Truths about an object that endure for its lifetime
