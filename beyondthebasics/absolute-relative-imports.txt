Absolute Imports

# imports which use a full path to the module
# i.e. from reader.reader import Reader

Relative Imports

# imports which use a relative path to modules
  in the same package (top level packages)
# i.e. from .reader import Reader

e.g.

from ..a import A
from .b import B

farm/
|-- __init.py
|-- bird/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- chicken.py
|   |-- turkey.py
|-- bovine/
    |-- __init__.py
    |-- cow.py
    |-- ox.py
    |-- common.py

from .common import ruminate
# or use
from . import common

# 1. Can reduce typing in deeply nested package structures
# 2. Promote certain forms of modifiability
# 3. Can aid package renaming and refactoring
# 4. General advice is to avoid them in most cases
